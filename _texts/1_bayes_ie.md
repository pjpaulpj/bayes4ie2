title: Why Bayes makes sense for DFEs

Here at IDinsight, one of the main services that we offer our clients is what we call "decision-focused evaluations" (DFEs). In contrast to impact evaluations that seek to create general knowledge, such as whether a program “works,” DFEs seek to influence specific decisions, such as whether to implement a program in one way or another.  We call the former type of impact evaluation knowledge focused evaluations (KFEs) to distinguish them from DFEs. (For more on the argument for this distinction, check out [Shah et al]( http://www.3ieimpact.org/media/filer_public/2015/10/01/wp25-evaluations_with_impact.pdf).)

KFEs nearly always employ frequentist inference.  For the most part this makes sense: journal editors want to limit the number of false results from among all those published. 

In this website, I attempt to show that, for DFEs, Bayesian inference often makes a lot more sense than KFEs.  The examples that I present later in this website provide concrete examples of how Bayesian inference can be useful in designing and analyzing data from DFEs, but here I provide a quick overview of why, for DFEs, a Bayesian perspective often makes sense.

First, DFEs often seek to inform a specific decision rather than a general audience. Thus, with DFEs, the need for a prior is a feature not a bug in that it allows us to take into account the prior beliefs of the decision-maker(s).  

Second, Bayesian inference allows evaluators to provide clear answers to program implementers. Rather that confusing hedging about p-values, evaluators can make statements like “based on this evaluation and our analysis, we believe there is a 30% chance that program A has a higher mean impact than program B.”  If evaluators have data on the cost of program A and B in the various places that the implementer work, the evaluator can make even clearer states of the form “you should focus exclusively on program A.”
