The examples included in this site are just a few of the many ways in which Bayesian analysis can be used in impact evaluations.  A few of the 

- Outcome-based adaptive randomization (a la Finucane and colleagues)
- Full modeling of latent variables
	- For example, with test scores, you can build a full model using IRT – this is quite difficult to do using frequentist stats.  You can estimate the variance and then use GLS or something, but this is a relatively crude way of incorporating uncertainty from the IRT model into your analysis
-	Partially observed outcomes – i.e. something like graduation rates where you observe for one cohort
