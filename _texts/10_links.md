Additional Resources for Understanding Bayesian Inference
--------
I have included links to additional resources on Bayesian inference below.  While these additional resources are great for getting a better understanding of Bayesian inference, it is perfectly possible to conduct Bayesian inference without fully understanding many of the topics covered in these resources.  In particular, given advances in computing, it is no longer necessary (and maybe even a waste of time for many) to understand the details of how a posterior is estimated such as the logic behind markov chain Monte Carlo sampling or variational Bayes.  Thus, please do read more if you are interested, but know that a complete understanding of most of the concepts in these books is not required for practical application of Bayesian inference for impact evaluations. 

1.	[Principles of Multilevel Modeling](https://bcpsqc.ca//documents/2012/11/hierarchical-modeling-greenland.pdf) by Sander Greenland
	If you only read one paper about Bayesian inference, then this should be it.  Short and readable.
2.	[Bayesian Adaptive Methods for Clinical Trials](https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Adaptive-Methods-Clinical-Biostatistics/dp/1439825483) by Berry et al. 
	This book contains a great, very readable introduction to Bayesian inference.  The rest of the book discusses the use of Bayesian inference for randomized controlled trials but caters to a bio-medical researcher audience.  Available in the IDinsight Delhi library. 
3. [Bayesian Data Analysis](http://www.amazon.in/Bayesian-Analysis-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1439840954) by Gelman et al
	This is considered the standard textbook on Bayesian analysis.  This book is Ok, but frankly I would recommend the resources above first.  Available in the IDinsight Delhi library.
4. [The Stata manual on Bayesian Analysis](http://www.stata.com/manuals14/bayes.pdf) This manual contains a good intro to Bayesian analysis.
