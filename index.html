<div class="introduction">

<p>This site provides a gentle(ish) introduction to the use of Bayesian analysis for the design and analysis of impact evaluations with a special focus on what we at IDinsight call "<a href="http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/publications/working-papers/3ie-working-paper-25/">decision-focused evaluations</a>."  <br><br>

We  assume familiarity with impact evaluations and how to design and analyze data from impact evaluations using standard frequentist techniques. We also assume basic familiarity with Stata.<br><br>

Comments, questions, and contributions welcome.  For those interested in contributing, please check out our contibuting page.
